# Hot Restaurant Application

## Overview

### Homework Assignment for UT Coding Bootcamp - Austin

* This is a restaurant booking application that allows for temporary data storage using Express.js
* Built on javascript using a variety of JS tools to power booking and waitlist functionality.
* In class assignment that I've gone back and recoded on my own using provided reference guides.

## Description of App

* Home Page gives the user the opportunity to Make Reservation, see current reservations as well as the waiting list
* Clicking on Make Reservation will provide a form in bootstrap that the user can complete.
* If there are less than 5 current table reservations, then that reservation is added to the reservation list.
* If there are more than 5 current table reservations, then that reservation is added to the waitlist. 
* The user can click on View Tables to see the current list of reservations and waitlists.
* At the bottom of the app, there are three links.
  * First link is to Clear Table which will empty out the arrays and basically reset the reservation list. 
  * The second link is to the API Table Link which shows the raw data objects for the table array.
  * The third link is to the API Wait List which shows the raw data objects for the Waitlist Array.
